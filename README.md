# PowerBISalesDashboard

The purpose of this exercise is to create a PowerBI Sales Dashboard using data from Adventure Works. 

The following are Key Sales Metric that I will be tracking:
(The formulas are from HubSpot, see: https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-metrics)

1) Total Revenue = Quantity of products and services sold x Price of the product or service

2) Market Penetration = Number of customers/Total Target Market Size

3) Percentage of Revenue From New Business = Revenue from new customers / Total revenue

4) Percentage of Revenue From Existing Customers = Revenue from existing customers / Total revenue

5) Year-Over-Year Growth = Current Year Metric - Previous Year Metric) / Previous Year Metric

Some data were missing, for example determining old vs new customers. The most recent customer purchase was from 2014, therefore I made the determination that all 2014 customers will be considered "new" customers and the rest would be "old/existing." 

Final dashboard:
